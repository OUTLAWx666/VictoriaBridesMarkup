			continue to attempt to charge your Payment Method provider until payment is received (upon receipt of payment, your account will be activated and for purposes of
			automatic renewal, your new subscription commitment period will begin as of the day payment was received).</p>

		<p>Please be aware that when you subscribe to any package, including the trial period, you will become liable for automatic renewal billing.</p>
